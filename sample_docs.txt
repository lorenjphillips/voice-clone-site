Voice Cloning Technology

Our voice cloning technology uses advanced neural networks to replicate human speech patterns. The system can clone a voice from just a few seconds of audio input.

Key Features:
- Real-time voice cloning
- High-quality audio output
- Minimal latency (under 200ms)
- Support for multiple languages

The ChatterboxTTS model is based on a 0.5B parameter architecture and has been trained on 500K hours of clean audio data.

We're excited to introduce Chatterbox, [Resemble AI's](https://resemble.ai) first production-grade open source TTS model. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control**, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out. Try it now on our [Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox)

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

# Key Details
- SoTA zeroshot TTS
- 0.5B Llama backbone
- Unique exaggeration/intensity control
- Ultra-stable with alignment-informed inference
- Trained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data
- Watermarked outputs
- Easy voice conversion script
- [Outperforms ElevenLabs](https://podonos.com/resembleai/chatterbox)

# Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


# Installation
```
pip install chatterbox-tts
```


# Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-1.wav", wav, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH="YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` for more examples.

# Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.

# üéôÔ∏è Voice Clone Site

A simple, powerful voice cloning website built with Chatterbox TTS. Generate natural-sounding speech with emotion control and voice cloning capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High-Quality TTS**: Neural text-to-speech with natural voice synthesis
- **Emotion Control**: Adjust exaggeration and pace for different speaking styles  
- **Voice Cloning**: Upload reference audio to clone specific voices (optional)
- **Web API**: RESTful API for easy integration
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive web interface
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for deployment to Render + Vercel

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- macOS (ARM64 optimized) or Linux

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd voice-clone-site

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API server
python api_server.py

# Open the web interface
open index.html
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the web interface will connect automatically.

## üåê Production Deployment

### Backend (Render)
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Connect to Render
3. Deploy as Web Service with:
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start: `python api_server.py`
   - Environment: `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`

### Frontend (Vercel)  
1. Update API URL in `index.html` to your Render backend
2. Deploy to Vercel (auto-detects static files)

## üì° API Usage

### Generate TTS
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-api.onrender.com/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello, this is a test!",
    "exaggeration": 0.7,
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "cfg_weight": 0.5
  }'
```

### Response
```json
{
  "audio_base64": "UklGRiQHAABXQVZFZm10...",
  "sample_rate": 24000,
  "message": "TTS generation successful"
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Voice Settings
- **Exaggeration** (0.25-2.0): Controls emotional expression
  - 0.5 = Neutral (default)
  - 0.7+ = More expressive
  - 1.5+ = Very dramatic

- **CFG/Pace** (0.0-1.0): Controls speaking pace
  - 0.5 = Normal pace (default)  
  - 0.3 = Slower, more deliberate
  - 0.7+ = Faster speech

- **Temperature** (0.05-2.0): Controls voice variation
  - 0.8 = Natural variation (default)
  - Lower = More consistent
  - Higher = More varied

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Content Creation**: Generate voiceovers for videos
- **Accessibility**: Convert text to speech for visually impaired users
- **E-learning**: Create narrated educational content
- **Podcasts**: Generate intro/outro segments
- **Voice Assistants**: Power conversational AI applications
- **Gaming**: Generate dynamic character voices

```

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Local (Mac)**: ~15-20 seconds per generation
- **Production**: ~10-15 seconds (with GPU acceleration)
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports multiple simultaneous requests
- **Audio Quality**: 24kHz sample rate, broadcast quality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**API not responding?**
```bash
# Check if server is running
python test_api.py

# Restart server
python api_server.py
```

**CORS errors in browser?**
- Update `allow_origins` in `api_server.py` with your frontend URL

**Slow generation?**
- Upgrade to Render Standard plan for GPU acceleration
- Close other applications during local development

## üí∞ Hosting Costs

- **Render** (Backend): $7-25/month
